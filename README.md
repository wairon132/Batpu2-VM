This repository is a fork of [BatPU2-VM](https://github.com/AdoHTQ/Batpu2-VM) by @wairon132 with some minor modifications.
The [BatPU-2](https://github.com/mattbatwings/BatPU-2)'s 1-bit display is replaced with a 16-bit color display, implemented by a redstone dust retexture, with full backwards compatibility with the previous 1-bit display.
